					<h1>SCRUM</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>What is Scrum Methodology</h3>
					<p>
						“A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while
						 productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.”
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>KEY IDEAS</h1>
					<p>
						Scrum is a lightweight, iterative and incremental framework for managing complex work.
						A key principle of Scrum is the dual recognition that customers will change the scope 
						of what is wanted and that there will be 
						unpredictable challenges — for which a predictive or planned approach is not suited
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Benefits of the Scrum methodology</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Faster development of quality products</li>
						<li>Increased return on investment and lower costs</li>
						<li>Decrease in time to market</li>
						<li>Increased customer satisfaction</li>
						<li>More motivated, productive and happier employees</li>
						<li>Reduced risk rate</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Scrum Roles</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Product Owner</li>
						<li>Scrum Master</li>
						<li>Development Team</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Product owner</h2>
					<p>
						This is the project’s key stakeholder. He or she is accountable for managing the product backlog.
						 The product owner is also responsible for maximizing the value of the product, the development 
						 team is working on.
						</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Scrum master</h2>
					<p>
						While the Scrum Master doesn’t have authority over the development team, he or she should make 
						sure that the team adheres to the Scrum theory, rules and values. The Scrum Master acts as a servant-leader
						 to the development team and the product owner. A facilitator, the Scrum Master helps the Scrum t
						 eam do their best
						</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Development team</h2>
					<p>
						The development team, being self-organizing and cross-functional has all the skills necessary to deliver
						 a “potentially releasable Increment of “Done” product at the end of each Sprint”. The team members hold
						  no titles and no one, including the Scrum Master, tells them “how to turn Product Backlog into Increments
							 of potentially releasable functionality.”
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Scrum Artifacts</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Product Backlog</li>
						<li>Sprint Backlog</li>
						<li>Increment</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Scrum Events</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>The Sprint</li>
						<li>Sprint Planning</li>
						<li>Daily Scrum</li>
						<li>Sprint Review</li>
						<li>Sprint Retrospective</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Tools for implementation</h1>
				<p>
					Like other agile methods, effective adoption of Scrum can be supported through a wide range of tools.
					Many companies use universal tools, such as spreadsheets to build and maintain a sprint backlog. There
					are also open-source and proprietary software packages which use Scrum terminology for product development 
					or support multiple product development approaches including Scrum.
					Other organizations implement Scrum without software tools and maintain their artifacts in hard-copy forms 
					such as paper, whiteboards, and sticky notes
				</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Limitations</h2>
				<ul>The benefits of Scrum may be more difficult to achieve when:
					<li>Teams whose members are geographically dispersed or part-time</li>
					<li>Teams whose members have very specialized skills</li>
					<li>Products with many external dependencies</li>
					<li>Products that are mature or legacy or with regulated quality control</li>
				</ul>
