					<h1>SCRUM</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>What is Scrum Methodology</h3>
					<p>
						“A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while
						 productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.”
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>KEY IDEAS</h1>
					<p>
						Scrum is a lightweight, iterative and incremental framework for managing complex work.
						A key principle of Scrum is the dual recognition that customers will change the scope 
						of what is wanted and that there will be 
						unpredictable challenges — for which a predictive or planned approach is not suited
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Benefits of the Scrum methodology</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Faster development of quality products</li>
						<li>Increased return on investment and lower costs</li>
						<li>Decrease in time to market</li>
						<li>Increased customer satisfaction</li>
						<li>More motivated, productive and happier employees</li>
						<li>Reduced risk rate</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Scrum team</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Product Owner</li>
						<li>Scrum Master</li>
						<li>Development Team</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Product owner</h2>
					<p>The product owner, representing the product's stakeholders and the voice of the customer
						 , is responsible for delivering good business results.
						</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Developers</h2>
					<p>The developers carry out all work required to build increments of value every sprint.
						The term developers refers to anyone who plays a role in the development and support of the system
						 or product, and can include researchers, architects, designers, data specialists, statisticians,
							analysts, engineers, programmers, and testers, among others
						</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Scrum master</h2>
					<p>Scrum is facilitated by a scrum master, who is accountable for removing impediments to the ability
						 of the team to deliver the product goals and deliverables. The scrum master is not a 
						 traditional team lead or project manager but acts as a barrier between the team and any distracting
						  influences. The scrum master ensures that the scrum framework is followed by coaching the team in
							 scrum theory and concepts, often facilitating key sessions, and encourages the team to grow and to improve.
							</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Scrum Artifacts</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Product Backlog</li>
						<li>Sprint Backlog</li>
						<li>Increment</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Scrum Events</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>The Sprint</li>
						<li>Sprint Planning</li>
						<li>Daily Scrum</li>
						<li>Sprint Review</li>
						<li>Sprint Retrospective</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Tools for implementation</h1>
				<p>
					Like other agile methods, effective adoption of Scrum can be supported through a wide range of tools.
					Many companies use universal tools, such as spreadsheets to build and maintain a sprint backlog. There
					are also open-source and proprietary software packages which use Scrum terminology for product development 
					or support multiple product development approaches including Scrum.
					Other organizations implement Scrum without software tools and maintain their artifacts in hard-copy forms 
					such as paper, whiteboards, and sticky notes
				</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Limitations</h2>
				<ul>The benefits of Scrum may be more difficult to achieve when:
					<li>Teams whose members are geographically dispersed or part-time</li>
					<li>Teams whose members have very specialized skills</li>
					<li>Products with many external dependencies</li>
					<li>Products that are mature or legacy or with regulated quality control</li>
				</ul>
