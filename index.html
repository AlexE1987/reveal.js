				<section>
					<h1>KEY IDEAS</h1>
					<p>
						Scrum is a lightweight, iterative and incremental framework for managing complex work.
						A key principle of Scrum is the dual recognition that customers will change the scope 
						of what is wanted and that there will be 
						unpredictable challenges â€” for which a predictive or planned approach is not suited
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Scrum team</h1>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Product owner</h2>
					<p>The product owner, representing the product's stakeholders and the voice of the customer
						 , is responsible for delivering good business results.
						</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Developers</h2>
					<p>The developers carry out all work required to build increments of value every sprint.
						The term developers refers to anyone who plays a role in the development and support of the system
						 or product, and can include researchers, architects, designers, data specialists, statisticians,
							analysts, engineers, programmers, and testers, among others
						</p>
				</section>
				<section><h2>Scrum master</h2>
					<p>Scrum is facilitated by a scrum master, who is accountable for removing impediments to the ability
						 of the team to deliver the product goals and deliverables. The scrum master is not a 
						 traditional team lead or project manager but acts as a barrier between the team and any distracting
						  influences. The scrum master ensures that the scrum framework is followed by coaching the team in
							 scrum theory and concepts, often facilitating key sessions, and encourages the team to grow and to improve.
							</p>

					<h1>Limitations</h1>
				<ul>The benefits of Scrum may be more difficult to achieve when:
					<li>Teams whose members are geographically dispersed or part-time</li>
					<li>Teams whose members have very specialized skills</li>
					<li>Products with many external dependencies</li>
					<li>Products that are mature or legacy or with regulated quality control</li>
				</ul>
